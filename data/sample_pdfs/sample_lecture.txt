# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

## Basic Structure
- Input Layer: Receives data
- Hidden Layers: Process information  
- Output Layer: Produces results

## Learning Process
Neural networks learn through backpropagation, adjusting weights to minimize error.

## Applications
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Predictive modeling
